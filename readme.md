The problem
-----------

Writing a formal letter is not always a simple thing. Even though composing the content of the letter may only take a few minutes, creating the actual document and getting the formatting right takes much much more time than it really should. This is where markdownletter enters the story.     

The markdownletter approach
---------------------------

Since formal letters need to look, well, formal you do not want to add more formatting than needed. With markdownletter you can write your letters in [Markdown][] while following a few conventions. When you're done you can create a pdf document which you can then print right away.
